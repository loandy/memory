# Memory

## Introduction

This is my first game project. I "finished" this game in a little less than a week while taking a break from focusing on another personal programming project.

The original intent was to create a functional clone of the Card Pairs mini-game from Fable.  I had found quite by accident that playing this game repeatedly and over a sustained period of time improved my recall of relevant memories throughout my day-to-day activities, and I have since been wanting to play the Card Pairs mini-game without having to fire up an entire other game just to access it.

**Note:** *The in-game interface is pretty minimal, and there is no in-game menu as of yet, so you may not want to play it in fullscreen mode.*

## Getting Started

Download and install [Unity 5](https://unity3d.com/get-unity).  Open the repository directory as a project and wait for it to repopulate some basic files, then open the `Memory.unity` scene under `/Assets/Scenes`. If you wish to play, simply build the game for your target platform.

## How to Play

Press the spacebar to pause the game.

Click on the "deck" on the left to deal the cards. You should only be able to deal cards when a game is not currently in progress.

## Implementation

Implemented in [Unity 5](https://unity3d.com/).

## Assets

All graphical assets were done by me.  All audio assets are royalty-free (Kevin MacLeod has a ridiculously prodigious amount of works):
